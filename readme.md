This is a proof of concept implementation of CircuitCocircuit algorithm for finding all small k-way bonds in a graph. The algorithm was devised by prof. Petr Hliněný.

Installation
------------

With GCC `>= 4.9`:

* Install OGDF into `~/.bin/ogdf` (or elsewhere but edit Makefile)
* Run `make` in the directory with this program

To install OGDF you can do:

	mkdir ~/.bin && cd ~/.bin
	git clone git@github.com:ogdf/ogdf.git && cd ogdf
	./makeMakefile.sh && make


Input/output file specification
-------------------------------

**Input** Each line contains one edge described in format `<edge id>;<source node id>;<target node id>`

**Output** Each line contains one cut: edge indicies joined by comma (e.g. `1,2,3`)

Run
---

In `bin/`:

**mincuts**

	Usage:	mincuts <edge_file.csv> <cut size bound> <# of components> [-bfc]

		<# of components> can be exact or range (e.g. 2-3)
		-bfc --	use bruteforcing of all combinations instead of
			CircuitCocircuit algorithm


**cutcheck**

	Usage:	cutcheck <edge_file.csv> [-imc, --ismincut <list>] [-cc <list>]
			[-rcc <cuts file>] [-tcc[f] <cuts file>]

			-imc    -- verifies if <list> is cut and minimal one
			-cc     -- computes # of components of G\<list>
			-rcc    -- randomized cuts check
			-tcc[f] -- total cuts check, 'f' counts all failures

	*list* is comma separated list of edge indicies.

**cutdiff**

	Usage: cutdiff <file A with cuts> [<file B with cuts> | ~]
	Output:
		* Set difference A\B (note that B\A is not computed)
		* Each cut of A and B is considered a set
		* '~' replaces second file with empty set

**tester**

	Usage:	tester <cut size bound> <# of components>
			[-r, --randomized <# of nodes> <min>-<max edges>] [-tN]

		This program tests CircuitCocircuit implementation.
		Expects graphs in nauty's graph6 format on stdin.

		First two arguments are used for any graph being tested.
		<# of components> can be exact or range (e.g. 2-3)
		-r generate random graphs (won't use stdin input)
		<max edges> is not strict (if the random graph is disconnected
			then we add edges to connect it)
		-tN use N threads (by default N == 2)

One can use this tester with program `geng` from package [nauty](http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/) to systematically test this implementation. E.g. run `geng -cq 8 | tester 4 4` to test all graphs on eight nodes. For testing bigger classes of graphs (like graphs on 10 vertices) it is recommended to use the `res/mod` option of `geng`.

-----------

In `tools/`:

**csv2dot.sh**

Reads csv file with graph (path to file given in first argument) and prints it in the dot format (used by GraphViz).

**test_on_graph.sh**

Compares CircuitCocircuit implementation output with cuts computed by "brute-force" algorithm generating all combinations of edges which form a minimal cut.

**geng_tester.sh**

Uses tool `geng` from package `nauty` to generate all the connected graphs and passes them to `tester` (see above in `bin/`). It starts from 2 vertices and continues towards 32 vertices (which would take forever to process).

**names2ids.py**

Converts from [ClosureSim](http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xsvobo38/closuresim/) output format to `mincuts` format.

	./tools/names2ids.py data/zlin-silnice.csv < temp/closuresim/results-2.csv > ires-2


**size_split**

Splits `mincuts` results file by cut size.

**Runtime measurement related tools**

* `measure_k_m_var.sh` -- runs `mincuts` with different values of `k` (in `k`-bonds) and `m` (max # of elements of the `k`-bonds)
* `measure2tex_k_m_var.sh` -- formats the output of the above tool into a TeX table
* `rtm2bonds_gen_acc_to_quartile.py` -- splits the records in the output of `mincuts-rtm` (see below "Measure runtime") by quartiles of the time axis, sums # of bonds generated by the records grouped by ranges marked by the quartiles and outputs a TeX table

Data
----

**Graph 5**

`Graph 5` is good to understand how the algorithm works. It can be found in `sample-data/graph5.csv`.

**Zlín Region**

Road network of the [Zlín Region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zl%C3%ADn_Region) can be found in `sample-data/zlin.csv`

**Getting new data from OpenStreetMap**

You can export data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and process them with [osm4routing](https://github.com/Tristramg/osm4routing) to get `csv` file.

You will probably want to select just data relevant to you. For example extract just certain roads:

	$ awk -F',' 'NR > 1 {if ($5 > "1") { print $1";"$2";"$3 }}' edges_raw.csv

This excludes edges which have 0 or 1 in the fifth column and thus are forbidden for cars or they are residential streets. See osm4routing page for detailed information.

**Note** that if you want to analyze the road network of anything bigger than few cities then the OSM data has the problem that each small road junction has its own node which makes analysis of anything bigger impossible. (If you solve the problem and extract a graph where each node represents a single city then let me know!)

Measure runtime
---------------

One can measure the runtime of the algorithm implementation by building the program with `make mincuts-rtm` (this requires the `boost` C++ library to be installed). All runs will then produce `mincuts_rtm.log` file. Each line of that file contains a record about change of state when some edge `e` is added to `X` in an `extendBond` call (note that if your `k`-bonds have `k > 2` then `extendBond` calls are nested). Line contents (tab separated):

* current stage of the algorithm (note `j`-bonds are created in stage `j-1`)
* time spent in the `genStage` call in milliseconds
* number of bonds generated with given `X` union `{e}`
